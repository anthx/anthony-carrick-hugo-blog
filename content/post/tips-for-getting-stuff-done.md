1. If you can’t concentrate at home, go to the library to study.
2. Put YouTube/streaming service/podcast on while you wash up the dishes if you don’t want to wash up. 
3. N95 masks prevent pollen and stuff
4. Listening to podcasts while you drive might be making you tired. If you are worn out after a > 30 minute drive, try not listening to a podcast.
5. If you want to read, go to a park nearby to prevent distractions. (Related to the first one I know, but mindset is important.)
6. Wear sunscreen.
7. Get your skin checked.
8. For that matter, go to the dentist and GP for checkups. You may be able to try teaching dentists too, it may be cheaper.
9. Make chores bearable by putting on YouTube or podcasts. 
10. Or be mindful of the joy that a clean house can bring!
