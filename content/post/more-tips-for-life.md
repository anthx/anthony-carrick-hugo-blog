More tips I've been compiling in Trello boards that I thought I'd share.

## Cooking and Meal-making!

1. Cook enough so that you can have left-overs. If you are going to all the effort, may as well make it count!
2. Keep some frozen pasta meals on hand, so you can just add your own vegetables that day or night. Fresh or frozen veggies.
3. If you're going to cook sausages or oven-baked fish or patties, try to cook a few extra at once, again for left-overs (Microwave later for a sandwich or whatever). You're already using the gas/electricity and time/effort so help out future-you!
4. Add an egg and/or frozen veggies to your instant noodles (in the sauce-pan, not cup noodles) to get more protein and fibre whilst still being an easy and tasty meal.
