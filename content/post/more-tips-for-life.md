More tips I've been compiling in Trello boards that I thought I'd share. Probably this is common knowledge, but the reminders never hurts.

Note well that these tips are in no particular order and don't necessarily relate to each other. You can use any of them or none or all of them! It's really just something to think about based on my own experience.

## Cooking and Meal-making!

1. Cook enough so that you can have left-overs. If you are going to all the effort, may as well make it count! This is easier with stir-fries or pasta-dishes etc.
2. Keep some frozen pasta meals on hand, so you can just add your own vegetables that day or night. Fresh or frozen veggies.
3. If you're going to cook sausages or oven-baked fish or patties, try to cook a few extra at once, again for left-overs (Microwave later for a sandwich or whatever). You're already using the gas/electricity and time/effort so help out future-you!
4. Add an egg and/or frozen veggies to your instant noodles (in the sauce-pan, not cup noodles) to get more protein and fibre whilst still being an easy and tasty meal.
5. Don't forget about simple meals like cheese toasties or baked-beans on toast. Sure it's not fancy, but it's cheaper than going out and still tasty!

## Chores and Tidying-up!

1. If you're unmotivated to clean or tidy, try putting on some fun music or podcasts to "get in the groove". I like to have the remove handy so I can pause it I need to concentrate on the sorting-out.
2. Give yourself a set area to sort out (like a certain shelf or cupboard) so you at least get something done and you can feel a sense of achievement!
3. If you are feeling particularly motivated one time, [KonMari](https://konmari.com/what-is-konmari-method/) all your clothes or books or other whole category of stuff!
4. If you're feeling frazzled, just dump all the clutter into a box so you can put it away in a cupboard and then deal with it later. At least you have a clean desk or dresser, to clear your mind first. 

### Bonus

1. Plan a gathering a your place so you have a "good reason" to tidy up.
2. Plan to have a drive with friends so that you also have a "good reason" to tidy up the car.
