Iï»¿ use the classic version of YNAB (You Need a Budget) to maintain my personal budget. But its budget is monthly and I'd like to be able to see my spending as a proportion of the current month. This way I can see that (for example) I'm only 10 days into the month (32%) but have spent say $75 of my takeaway budget and I'm about to go over if I kept spending in this way.
