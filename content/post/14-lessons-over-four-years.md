I've gone through a lot of growth over the past few years since the pandemic and other coinciding life experiences. I thought I'd share what I've learned or rediscovered.


* Trust your instincts (around potentially dangerous situations or people you get a bad feeling of). [^1]

* If you still have a bad feeling, but think it might be OK, double check before committing, keeping your instincts in mind.

* If it seems to good to be true, it probably is.

* Don't make big decisions while panicking or depressed.

* Be sure you know all the facts before committing to something.

* Try new things, talk to new people (both safely of course).

* If you think, "I might regret this but...", don't do it. You probably will regret it. 

* It doesn't hurt to ask. (In life and work. Usually, the most they can say is "no".)

* Reach out to people. They might want to hear (back) from you too.

* Drink enough water, eat enough food, get enough sleep.

* Bad environments can cause stress.

* Nice environments can be healthy. 

* Hesitate before buying something. If you keep wanting that product after a few weeks, you might actually want it. [^2]

* If you keep coming back to a thought or idea over several months or years [^3], that might be worth investigatingâ€¦

[^1]: This could work in reverse too, that if you are feeling confident about a situation or person, it might be work considering. 

[^2]: use this time to save up if you need to. Wait longer for more expensive products. If you don't want it still, you might just be bored and want any new shiny thing.

[^3]: covering stable mental health periods, in case you just need to get over a hump. I mean ideas or plans or things you've "always wanted to do or try".
