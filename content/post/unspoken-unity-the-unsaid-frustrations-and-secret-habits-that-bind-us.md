I like to talk openly to people and find out what feelings and traits we share - bond over a shared dislike of certain aspects of life. It helps to know that we aren’t alone in feeling frustrated or sad or bored in various situations. Sometimes I discover these things at parties, hikes, late night phone calls, group chats once you get to know them.

Think of this post as a little Am I Normal post, but condensed and with some kind thoughts.

## We like to sit in the car and think instead of going inside

Sitting in the car after getting home seems to be a popular way to “decompress” from your drive home or event, before coming into your housemates or empty house or chaotic family. I met some people on a hike that like to sit in the car for a few minutes - finish the podcast, finish the song, or just relax after a hard drive. Just make sure to let your partner know why you are sitting in the car still so they don’t worry.

## We clean up the car or house when we are having people over

I also discovered on the hike that other people leave their car cleaning to the road trip or picking up friends. While I try to keep my car reasonably tidy, I certainly do give it a more proper tidy when I’m expecting people in the car. It’s OK, if this helps you, who cares, tidy it when you want or need to.

## It seems we are unhappy, unsettled, concerned about future

Just a feeling I get when I talk openly with friends that the cost of living is going up, climate change is causing death and destruction, crime seems like it’s increasing, the heat is causing humans anger and technology to stop working.

## Most of us secretly frustrated by our routines

We don’t like the routine of going to work, coming home, suddenly it’s late, suddenly it’s bedtime. Do it again. Some people don’t seem to mind, but really even if we can accept it, many of us seem not to really like it. It feels like there’s just not enough time. Try to do less, then the 4 - 5 hours after work is more acceptable.

## We do not want to go to sleep because of anxiety

This might not be that common actually, but a few people I know have expressed a feeling of not wanting to go to sleep, but kind of needing to still. Might be just going to sleep, that’s why apps like Calm or Headspace or Sleepiest are popular with sleep stories and calming music, even Android has some sleep sounds built-in now.

## Water is boring to us

Many people find water boring unless we are really thirsty, water has no flavour but it’s cheap and healthy. When we aren’t that thirsty, we’d rather drink juice or soft drink, or mix it with water to at least add some flavour to the water.

# In Conclusion…
I don’t know what to do about this particularly if you are feeling these ways, aside from just accepting them as not uncommon, knowing that you aren’t alone. Talk to a friend about this, maybe they experience little frustrations too, or are unhappy in their job or routine, or don’t like water or cooking every night. 

Take care now, OK?
