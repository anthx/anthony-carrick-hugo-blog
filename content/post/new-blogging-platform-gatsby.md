I’ve started this new blog on Gatsby and Netlify to take over from acarrick.com/blog and some of [acarrick.com/projects](https://acarrick.com/projects). And also become a better personal website than my other domain, acarrick.com became. My website over there doesn’t really fit with the rest of the software development community blog/portfolio/resume style - it’s the wrong style. Since I still have links to (business cards and by-lines) I’ll archive it and reduce the overhead. 

I was going to move everything from [acarrick.com/projects](https://acarrick.com/projects) over here, but the more I re-read it, the more I realised it didn’t matter as it was relevant for my study time and the projects there are finished or abandoned. So I’ve just moved  acarrick.com/blog over here as that site was later and intended to be a generic blog rather than study and learning projects.

At the original (and still up) acarrick.com/projects blog I discussed some learning projects I did while studying, as well as the courses I studied as part of my [Graduate Diploma in Information Technology.](https://www.acarrick.com/projects/ive-graduated/)
