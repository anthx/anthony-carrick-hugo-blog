This is the final in my series of random tips for life (for the near future at least), this time about
transportation and planning errands. Over my years of going places I've
worked out what helps me travel with less fuss and stress. I'll admit
that some of these tips I've only just started to implement myself and
not all of them are always easy to do, but great if you can!

# Getting to work calmly

1. Try not to rush by leaving earlier than you think or at the very least, on time. This way you aren't anxious about being late or worried about the traffic. Work backwards from your job's start time minus enough time to settle down.

2. If taking public transport, read a novel or relaxing book. Or watch a
show if longer commute. You might even like to just do nothing and let
your brain think as it pleases. I'm finding it beneficial to give myself
time for my mind to be idle.

# Driving Places

1. If you have a choice, try to drive when there's less traffic.

2. Take the routes you are familiar with and more comfortable on even if itm might be a bit longer. (To a sensible point though of course.)

3. Try putting on classical music to calm you down if you find driving can be stressful. Without lyrics, it shouldn't be too distracting.

4. But if it's really busy or you're driving in a unfamiliar area, you might like to not have any music on so you can really focus. It's ok to need to focus on driving!

5. When driving to an errand over 20 to 30 minutes away, you might find it more fun to plan a couple of things to at your destination before or after your errand. This way you may feel a little bit more fulfilled after all that driving.

# Being on time

1. Work backwards from your arrival time to calculate your departure time.
(Then add a few extra minutes to get in the car or head in the train.)

2. When planning your arrival time, aim to be there 10 to 20 minutes before you need to be. This way you know you have some buffer time.

3. Bring a book or game or some other entertainment so you can arrive early and wait patiently.

4. If you carry things in an every day carry bag / purse, use the same one so it\'s always ready to go and you aren\'t fumbling around finding things, making you more stressed and late!
