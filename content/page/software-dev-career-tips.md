# Q&A With Harold (a tech recruiter) #

## Resumes ##
* List your job roles, duration, and key responsibilities.
* put skills at the top
* volunteering and meetups are good to put on there too.
* put a link to portfolio on the resume
* He says people hire you for your enthusiasm as a recent grad...
* Leave references off so you have control over if they get contacted. "Referees available upon request" (I've heard similar too.)
* don't bother with the expertise ratings - it's subjective anyway.

## Targeting ##
* Go to Meetups.
* Chat to people doing the job you want, at companies you want to work at - via LinkedIn or plain email. No need to result in an interview, just talking. He says it's actually OK to followup (nicely).
* Contribute to open source

## Contact ##
* Find out the name of the hiring manager. Research them on LinkedIn or something.
* Use full name if finance or similar, their first name is OK if a casual startup or such.

## Expectations ##
* There are many roles in software development beyond coding.

## Interviews ##
* Don't be afraid of the interviewers
* Be honest - no point in doing crap you don't even like...
* Talk out your thinking in technical interviews.
* Do research on the company, standard really
* Ask questions that are important to you so that you know if you want to work there even.
