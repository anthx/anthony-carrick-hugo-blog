## What is this?

Weekend Notes is an Australian leisure website and newsletter where anyone can contribute and optionally get paid for your contributions. Topics include:

* restaurant reviews
* day trip ideas
* upcoming events
* movie reviews
* lists of... date ideas/waterfalls/beaches/bubble tea (whatever else you can think of)

I like to write about parks and nature reserves, and restaurant reviews if the place particularly appeals to me.
